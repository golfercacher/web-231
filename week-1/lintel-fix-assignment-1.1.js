/*Original code was using == and should be using =.
; == is not an assignment operator, = is.
; as written the code was essentially stating 
; is variable firstNumber equal to 16
;   Original code
;   var firstNumber == 16;
*/

//fixed code that states firstNumber is assigned the value of 16
var firstNumber = 16;

var secondNumber = 25;

/* Original code was using a capital C for console
; my debugger threw an error and I changed it to a lower 
; case c and it executed.  
; it is case sensitive.
; original code
; Console.log(firstNumber + secondNumber);
*/

//fixed code - capital C change to lower case c
console.log(firstNumber + secondNumber);
